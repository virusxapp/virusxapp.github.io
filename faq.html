                    <p>By downloading, installing and registering on VirusX app, you will have access to our network of services that track known and new viruses. The app runs unobtrusively without any user intervention. The VirusX service will only send an alert if you the user may have been in close vicinity of a verified infected person. This "trace" conducted by us, allows healthcare agencies around the world reduce the risk of viral spread.</p>
					<p> Our accuracy in virus exposure alerts depends on different factors such as VirusX users and usage, infection reporting, infection verification. We strive to give you the most accurate alerts, we ask that users of VirusX refer it to their friends and family to help us provide a very accurate service.</p>
					<p>The VirusX app is similar to other major Social Network apps which send data signals to servers to provide their services. The connection between the app and the servers are also encrypted.</p>
					<p>	If you are uncomfortable with such a scenario, please do not install and user the app. By doing so we cannot alert you of a virus exposure.</p>

                    <p>Novel Coronavirus COVID-19 (formerly 2019-nCoV) is a virus (more specifically, a coronavirus) identified as the cause of an outbreak of respiratory illness first detected in Wuhan, China. Early on, many of the patients in the outbreak in Wuhan, China reportedly had some link to a large seafood and animal market, suggesting animal-to-person spread. However, a growing number of patients reportedly have not had exposure to animal markets, indicating person-to-person spread is occurring. At this time, it’s unclear how easily or sustainably this virus is spreading between people. </p>
					<p>For confirmed COVID-10 infections, reported illnesses have ranged from people with little to no symptoms to people being severely ill and dying. <p>Symptoms can include:</p>
					<p>-Fever</p>
					<p>-Cough</p>
					<p>-Shortness of breath</p>

                    <p>-Seek medical care right away. Before you go to a doctor’s office or emergency room, call ahead and tell them about your recent travel and your symptoms.</p>
					<p>-Avoid contact with others.</p>
					<p>-Not travel while sick.</p>
					<p>-Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue or your sleeve (not your hands) when coughing or sneezing.</p>
					<p>-Wash hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds to avoid spreading the virus to others. Use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol if soap and water are not available. </p>
